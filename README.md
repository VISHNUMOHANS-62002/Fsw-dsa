Data Structures and algorithms
 Data Types
   Primitive
     .Int,float,char
      Non Primitive 
         linear   Nonlinear
  Linear:Array,Stack,Qeue,lists
  Nonlinear:tree,graph
Array:Can be acessed randomly
Stack:Follow LIFO(last in first out) cannot be acessed randomly

Main Operations in DSA
Insertion:push()
Deletion:pop()
Updation:
Searching:
Sorting:
Qeue:Follow the FIFO(First in first out)
  here for insertion we have enqeue and for deletion we have deqeue
List:
Single Linked list
     value,address
Double Linked List
   address,value,address(can travel in both direction)

Single Circular Linked List
    Same as the single LL instead of null address in the end we have the address of the head and vice versa
Double Circular Linked List 
    Same as the double LL instead of null address in the end we have the address of the head and vice versa
